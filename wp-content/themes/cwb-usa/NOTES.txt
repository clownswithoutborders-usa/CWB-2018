NOTES

CiviCRM:

1. /public_html/stage/stage/.. contains a couple js files that could not be loaded because subdomain
2. /public_html/stage/wp-content/uploads/civicrm/civicrm.settings.php top of file: changes to default directories because subdomain

CiviMail doesn't work because cron not running

PayPal: may need temp merchant account

Content: 
Lat/long coordinates for projects didn't come through for all of them (see 8 projects on equator S of Ghana)
Actually many custom fields didn't come through for more recent (since 1/2016) imports - does this matter?

//put together side navigation and right sidebar like comps.

What makes side navigation exist? Is editable? 
Yes: create page template for each section (our work section, about us section, etc)
register nav menu for each section
create/edit in Menus UI
assign menus to page templates, NOT user choice per page like Tobey's site

So: 
Our Work (top-level intro page for this section): Our Work page template (default for the section)
Latest or Projects: Could be archive-project.php, Our Work page template (w/shortcode for special things?) or some other page template, over to AP on this
Where We Work or Counntries: same as above
All other secondary pages in this section: Our Work page template (default)
